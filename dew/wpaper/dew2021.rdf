Title: Using Excel to Teach Principles of Microeconomics
Abstract: Teaching introductory economics is difficult because students often do not have the terminology and tools needed to understand economics concepts and models. To communicate these ideas, the successful principles instructor must prioritize concreteness and avoid abstraction. Spreadsheets offer clear visual displays of data and theoretical results, making them a natural way to teach introductory economics and develop true competency. Two Excel add-ins, FRED and Solver, are highlighted in examples that can be integrated easily into any principles of microeconomics course. A macro-enabled workbook to introduce the idea of emergent order is provided (http://academic.depauw.edu/~hbarreto/working/LangtonsAnt/LangtonsAnt.xlsm) and a few online resources for teaching with spreadsheets are also mentioned. Integrating spreadsheet-based pedagogy into a principles of microeconomics course will improve learning outcomes.

Title: Postbellum Electoral Politics in California and the Genesis of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
Abstract: After the Civil War, the Democratic party carried an important electoral penalty 
from being associated with the war. To deal with this penalty, the party took increasingly 
anti-immigration positions to compete with Republicans. This led some Republican strongholds
such as California to become competitive and also forced Republicans to embrace stricter
immigration proposals. In this paper, we argue that adopting anti-immigration and raising
awareness against immigration made California increasingly competitive in electoral terms.
This electoral competitiveness can serve to explain the genesis of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.

Title: The Impact of Place-Based Policy: Evidence from a Multiple Synthetic Control Analysis of the Northeastern Revitalization Program in China
Abstract: We examine the effect of a well-known place-based policy in China, the Northeastern Revitalization Program. In 2003, the State Council of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China initiated the program in northeastern China by removing an agricultural tax, enhancing the urban social security system, facilitating foreign investments, and restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the region. Using a budding case-study approach (the synthetic control method), we find that the program had no significant effect on GDP per capita in all three regions. Liaoning had slightly worse GDP per capita post-treatment, as well as Heilongjiang (albeit to a less extent). While the multiple synthetic control analysis shows that economic outcomes were worse post-treatment, the impact of this program was heterogeneous across the three regions. We argue the lackluster performance likely comes from the continuing dominance of inefficient SOEs in the provinces.
