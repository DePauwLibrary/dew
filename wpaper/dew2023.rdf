Title: One-shot Economic Mobility via Microsoft Excel
Abstract: This paper explains how to use a macro-enabled Excel workbook, Mobility.xlsm, to teach basic concepts about intergenerational mobility as a standalone, one-time class or assignment at the undergraduate level. The focus is on explaining the results from Chetty et al. (2014) which tracks the parent’s place in the income distribution and then their adult children’s income ranking. Simulation is used to explain the bottom-to-top transition probability and the transition matrix with strong visuals and concrete numbers. The workbook is entirely self-contained and has a series of questions to lead students through the material. This paper has suggested answers and further areas of study.  Download the freely-available Excel workbook at tiny.cc/mobilityexcel.
